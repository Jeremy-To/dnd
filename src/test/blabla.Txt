I see you're encountering an error with Jest in your React TypeScript project. The error message indicates there's a problem with the `setupFilesAfterEnv` configuration - specifically:

`Module @testing-library/jest-dom in the setupFilesAfterEnv option was not found.`

This means Jest can't find the @testing-library/jest-dom module that's being referenced in your configuration file.

To fix this issue:

1. First, make sure you have @testing-library/jest-dom installed:
   ```bash
   yarn add --dev @testing-library/jest-dom
   ```

2. Create or update your Jest configuration file. You can do this in one of these ways:
   - Create a jest.config.js file in your project root
   - Add Jest configuration to your package.json under a "jest" key

3. In your Jest config, make sure the path to the jest-dom setup file is correct:

   ```javascript
   // jest.config.js
   module.exports = {
     setupFilesAfterEnv: ['@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect'],
     // other configuration...
   }
   ```

4. If that doesn't work, try creating a setup file explicitly:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/setupTests
   ```

   Create a file `src/setupTests/jest-dom.js` with:
   ```javascript
   import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';
   ```

   Then update your Jest config:
   ```javascript
   // jest.config.js
   module.exports = {
     setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/setupTests/jest-dom.js'],
     // other configuration...
   }
   ```

Try running your tests again after making these changes.
